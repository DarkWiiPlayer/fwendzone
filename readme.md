# Fwendzone

**An application that lets you keep track of what time it is for your friends all
around the world.**

Anyone who has more than a few international friends knows how confusing it can
quickly get to keep track of what time it is at any moment for so many different
people. Fwendzone lets you create a simple list of friends and assign time zones
to them to easily look up exactly what time it is where they live.

Friend lists are saved in the browser and doesn't get sent anywhere else on the
internet, because honestly, why would it.
